This repository contains Primer AI's auxiliary datasets from our submissions to the acronym identification and acronym disambiguation shared tasks at [SDU@AAAI 2021](https://sites.google.com/view/sdu-aaai21/shared-task).

1. AuxAI: a distantly supervised dataset for acronym identification
2. AuxAD: a distantly supervised dataset for acronym disambiguation
3. SciAD-dedupe: a deduplicated version of the [SciAD dataset](https://github.com/amirveyseh/AAAI-21-SDU-shared-task-2-AD)

These datasets are described in detail in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08013).
